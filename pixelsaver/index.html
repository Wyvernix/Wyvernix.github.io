	  	<p class="para">This project started with a few wallpapers I found. There were very nice, but were poorly enlarged and didn't even fit my screen. That's where this program started. PixelSaver will get an image that was enlarged to something that wasn't a multiple of 2, and fix it. It will shrink it back down to its minimal farm through the magic of Java. See the example below for a better explanation.

	<h2>Instructions!</h2>
	<div>
	  	<p>Download this <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26842546/share/PixelSaver-v0.2.zip">PixelSaver-v0.2.zip</a> and save it somewhere.<br />
	  		You will need to verify your account.<br /><br />
	  		
	  		Note: you will need a somewhat-recent edition of Java. Found <a href="https://java.com/download">HERE</a><br /><br />
	  		
	  		To use it, just start the program and drop images in. You can select multiple at a time.

	  		<h2>Example:</h2><br />
	  		<u>Before<br /><br />
	  		<img src="before.png" alt="image1"><br /><br />
	  		After<br /><br /></u>
	  		<img src="after.png" alt="image1"><br /><br />
	  		Nice, uniform pixels :D
	  		<br /><br /><br />
	  		There is a known bug where the program will break some <a href='bad.png'>backgrounds</a>. The backgrounds it breaks shouldn't be too hard to fix, however.
