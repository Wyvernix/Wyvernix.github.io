	  	<p class="para">This project started with a few wallpapers I found. There were very nice, but were poorly enlarged and didn't even fit my screen. That's where this comes in. Pixel Saver will get an image enlarged to something that wasn't a multiple of 2 and fix it. It will shrink it back down to its prior state through the magic of Java.

	<br /><br />
	<h2>Instructions!</h2>
	<div>
	  	<p>Download this <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26842546/share/PixelSaver-v0.2.zip">PixelSaver-v0.2.zip</a> and save it somewhere.<br />
	  		You will need to verify your account.<br /><br />
	  		
	  		Note: you will need a somewhat-recent edition of Java. Found <a href="https://java.com/download">HERE</a><br /><br />
	  		
	  		To use it, just start the program and drop images in. You can select multiple at a time.

	  		<h2>Example:</h2><br />
	  		<u>Before<br /><br />
	  		<img src="before.png" alt="image1"><br /><br />
	  		After<br /><br /></u>
	  		<img src="after.png" alt="image1"><br /><br />
	  		Nice, uniform pixels :D
